That night, a good fairy heard him and made his wish to become real. “Awake, wood inanimate, now you’ve got a soul!” she made her magic spell touching Pinocchio with her magic wand. “Pinocchio , be always a good , brave and a selfless boy , ” said the Fairy , ” and one day you’ll be a real boy ! ” Then, she addressed to Jiminy Cricket: “I appoint you to guide Pinocchio, ” she added, before disappearing in a thousand flashes of light.</p>"
